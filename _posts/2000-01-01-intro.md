## Elevator Pitch

<div class="mhkphoto" style="height:30%"><img src="../img/hardlyworking.png" /></div>

I am a third-year Ph. D. student at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu) in biomedical engineering
with quite an eclectic variety of interests. My passions for computational
modeling, physics, and quantitative approaches to the life sciences have made
me explore the areas of biomedical imaging. Fittingly, my Ph. D. thesis is
centered around the molecular imaging of cancer. More specifically, I am
designing novel magnetic-resonance-based approaches to probing
bioelectrical activity to aid in the diagnosis of brain cancer.

I'm also a music enthusiast
and really good at memorizing song lyrics so you'll most likely find me walking
and singing something from the Top 40 / Billboard Hot 100 more often than not.
