## Elevator Pitch

<div class="mhkphoto" style="height:30%"><img src="../img/hardlyworking.png" /></div>

I am an incoming Ph. D. student at [Yale University](http://www.yale.edu) in biomedical engineering
with quite an eclectic variety of interests. My passions for computational
modeling, physics, and quantitative approaches to the life sciences have made
me explore the areas of biomedical imaging, with which my Ph. D. thesis will
most likely be concerned. I'm also a music enthusiast and really good at
memorizing song lyrics so you'll most likely find me walking and singing
something from the Top 40 / Billboard Hot 100 more often than not.
