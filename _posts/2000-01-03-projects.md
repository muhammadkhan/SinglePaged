# Projects

{% highlight bash linenos=table %}
typedef potential Opportunity;
Opportunity today = new Ideas();
{% endhighlight %}

These are all projects I have undertaken at my leisure, and can all be found
hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/muhammadkhan). Notable ones include:

* [**Curriculum ViTeX**](https://github.com/muhammadkhan/Curriculum-ViTeX): This
is a template engine I wrote for resumes/CVs written in LaTeX using XML.

* [**ABINIT Band Structure Plotting Tool**](https://github.com/muhammadkhan/Abinit-BandStructure-Plotting): A convenient plotting tool for band structures of
materials (i.e. k-space energy eigenvalues) using output data from the
[ABINIT](http://www.abinit.org) computational quantum mechanics package. (A
vestige from my summer in the [Hasan Group](http://physics.princeton.edu/zahidhasangroup/) at [Princeton](http://www.princeton.edu))

* [**Sniffy**](https://github.com/muhammadkhan/Sniffy): A really simple command-line
packet sniffer.
